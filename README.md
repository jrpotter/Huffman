Huffman Encoding
================

[VERSION 1.0.0 - 04/27/2014]

The following is a graphical implementation of the huffman encoding compression algorithm, done for
extra credit in one of my computer science classes. The program appears to work with the various files tested, 
though this testing was not rigorously performed.

It enables selection of files to compress; it will also display the compression table and decompression table during compression and decompression of files respectively.

To run:
```
git clone https://github.com/jrpotter/Huffman.git
cd Huffman/bin
java huffman.Main
```
