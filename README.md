Huffman Encoding
================

[VERSION 1.0.0 - 04/27/2014]

The following is a graphical implementation of the huffman encoding compression algorithm, done for
extra credit in one of my computer science classes. The program appears to work with the various files tested, 
though this testing was not rigorously performed.

Use with caution!

There will be no future updates.
